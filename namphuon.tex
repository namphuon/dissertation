Generating a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from 
a set of unaligned sequences is an important step in
estimating the evolutionary relationship between
different species.  The MSA can be used to infer homologies
between the different sequences, and from these homologies,
a phylogeny representing the evolutionary history of the species can be inferred.

In the situation where an MSA has
already been estimated on a set of sequences (called ``backbone alignment), new sequences (called ``query sequences) can be inserted into the MSA using a profile Hidden Markov Models (HMM), removing the need to re-estimate the MSA on the full set of sequences from scratch.  The basic algorithm for this approach is to first compute an HMM from the backbone alignment.  Next, the query sequences are inserted into the backbone alignment using the HMM.  This technique suffers, though, when the backbone alignment and query sequences are evolutionarily divergent~\cite{Mirarab2012}.  

In this dissertation, I present a new machine learning technique called families of HMMs (fHMMs) to address this problem.  By using multiple HMMs instead of a single HMM to represent a backbone alignment, query sequences can be more accurately aligned to the backbone alignment.  I apply the fMMs to three different problems: phylogenetic placement, taxonomic profiling and identification, and MSA estimation.  In phylogenetic placement, the problem addressed is how to insert a query sequence into an existing phylogeny.  In taxonomic identification and profiling, the problem addressed is how to taxonomically classification a query sequence, and how to estimate a taxonomic profile on a set of sequences.  Finally, in MSA estimation, the problem is how to estimate an MSA on a set of sequences.

For each problem, I present a software pipeline that implements the fMMs that is implemented specifically for that domain: SEPP for phylogenetic placement, TIPP for taxonomic profiling and identification, and UPP for MSA estimation.  I present simulation experiments to show that the fHMMs approaches result in improved accuracy compared to the single HMM approaches.  I show that SEPP results in more accurate phylogenetic placements compared to existing placement methods, and is more computationally efficient, both in peak memory usage and running time.  I show that TIPP more accurately classifies novel sequences, and estimates more accurate taxonomic profiles than leading methods on metagenomic datasets.  Finally, I show how UPP estimates ``de novo'' alignments, and is more accurate and efficient than than existing alignment methods.  I show that UPP can estimate a very accurate alignment on a dataset with 1,000,000 sequences in less than 2 days without the need of a supercomputer.

Nam-phuong Nguyen was born in Long Beach, California on 17 December 1981, the son of Manh Nguyen and Mai-phuong Nguyen.  He received the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Math degree from the University of Utah in 2004.  He worked at Global Aerospace for two years before deciding to head back to school for this Masters in Computer Science at the University of Utah in 2007.  There, he began work with Dr. Chris Myers on the simulation of genetic circuits and published his first paper, ``The Design of the Genetic Muller C-element''.  After completing his Masters degree in 2009, he began his Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin.
